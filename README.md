# NameSurfer
Created using the Stanford Java Library on Eclipse. This program allows the user to use a preset database filled with names of celebrities and their ratings from across the years. When their name is typed into the searchbar and graph is hit, the person's data points are searched for in the file and plotted on the graph with lines connecting each. You can compare the current person on the graph with another by typing in another person's name, whose ratings are graphed on top of the pervious one in a different color. Once you are satasfied, you can hit clear and all of the graphed lines are erased. The main points of this project were to demonstrate the use of the user interface with interactors such as buttons, pressing enter, and text boxes. In addition to this, scanners were used to search the file and the data was then plotted with GLines in between them. The different colors as more names were entered can be attributed to counters of how many current names are on the board. This was a checkpoint project that culminated everything previously learned in the class.
